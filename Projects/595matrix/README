Example code for 595 matrix kit.
================================

Example code uses SPI to transfer data to the matrix. The matrix needs to be connected to the SPI pins of Arduino.

Connections for SPI 
===================

 * 5V  - 5V
 * GND - GND
 * SER - pin 11
 * SCK - pin 13
 * RCK - pin 10


EXAMPLES
========

**example1** - Emulates PWM by using timer to refresh the display. This allows us to have different shades of colour.
**example2** - Modified version of example1 which supports multiple panels chained together.
